# Assessment Instrument 3 - BiData Exploration (Year 11 - Semester 2 - Data science)

## Overview

The purpose of this assignment is to use the code and techniques discussed in class to follow the data science process noting, in particular, the changes needed to handle Big Data. You will need to write a report that details your process through the steps below, as well as develop a codebase that will provide you with the data you need for your analysis.

## Step 1: Form a Hypothesis

The first thing you should be doing is figuring out an interesting question to ask. Once you have the question you can start looking for data sets that can answer it. If you can't figure out a question, it's also perfectly appropriate to find an interesting data set first, and then investigate it to see if you can find an interesting question within that dataset to explore.

The only stipulation here is that the dataset you ultimately select must contain a minimum of 1,000,000 rows of data so that you can demonstrate the big data techniques we've been looking at in class.
Your report should begin with you stating your Hypothesis, and then discussing the data set you'll be looking at and how you believe it relates to your hypothesis.

Examples of datasets to look at:

* <https://github.com/awesomedata/awesome-public-datasets>
* <https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/LondonDataStore/london-crime>

## Step 2: Process the data

Once you have an idea of what you need to look for, you'll need to clean the dataset to remove any erroneous or inappropriate values for your analysis. After cleaning the data, you should now be thinking about how you could visualise this data to address your hypothesis, and what big data techniques you'll need to use to ensure you can process the data effectively.
Your report for this step should be discussing how and why you cleaned the data set. You may need to sample before you clean the data, depending on the techniques you'll need to use to effectively analyse it later. Discuss this process here.

## Step 3: Visualisation

Using the big data techniques discussed in class, create a series (at least 3) of visualisations that relate to your hypothesis.

Your report should include these visualisations.

## Step 4: Analysis and Discussion

Analyse the visualisations you've presented and discuss how they support or contradict your hypothesis. An emphasis should be placed on analysing why the information supports/contradicts the hypothesis. You should also take this time to comment on any issues regarding bias and random sampling or other techniques that came up.

## Step 5: Conclusion

Lastly, conclude your report by discussing the social and ethical implications of your findings and what further data sets or investigations could take place if you were to continue examining those implications.

## Submission Files

There will be three key submission for this assignment:

* A report that details your findings of the 5 steps outlined above
The codebase that you developed and used to clean your data and produce your visualisations.
* A link to the dataset that you used for the analysis.
